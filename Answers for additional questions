What was the node size chosen for the Kubernetes nodes? And why?

I have gone through with the guest-book yaml files, as that is a light weight application, I tought default GCP kuberenetes cluster configuration is enough to serve our purpose. 
default configuration -  1 vCPU and 3.75 GB memory



What method was chosen to install the demo application and ingress controller on the cluster, justify the method used

I have used the yaml files provied by you and kubectl commands to create enviroment



What would be your chosen solution to monitor the application on the cluster and why?

I would have been choosen prometheus for monitoring and alerting and would prefer graphana to visulize the data.



What additional components / plugins would you install on the cluster to manage it better? 

1. GUI
2. Monitoring tools
